2278
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:03,900
Nothing's happening yet.

2279
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:06,300
But notice, the program
is still running.

2280
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:10,700
And so if I move my cursor, move
my cursor, move my cursor, and--

2281
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:12,880
[MEOWING]

2282
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,550
OK, so maybe we could add some Waiting.

2283
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:17,750
But the cat does not want
to be pet, in this case.

2284
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:20,220
But it's indeed conditional.

2285
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:22,380
So there we have an
incarnation in Scratch

2286
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:24,290
of doing something conditionally.

2287
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:26,790
Now, we can make this really
cool, really fast, if you will.

2288
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:28,440
Let me stop this version.

2289
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:31,270
Let me go ahead and do this.

2290
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:33,270
Let me go ahead and
throw all of this away.

2291
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:36,210
Let me go into my little
Extensions bucket over here.

2292
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:40,020
And let me do Video Sensing, since
most laptops or phones these days have

2293
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:40,620
cameras.

2294
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:44,190
And there, indeed, I am,
with Sanders behind me.

2295
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:45,780
And let me do this.

2296
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:48,900
When Video Motion-- and
let me get out of the way.

2297
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,820
When Video Motion is
Greater Than some value.

2298
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:55,920
So 10 is the default. This is just a
number that measures how much motion

2299
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:56,670
there is or isn't.

2300
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:58,290
So small number is like no motion.

2301
01:40:58,290 --> 01:40:59,920
Big number is lots of motion.

2302
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:03,120
So I'm going to choose 50,
somewhat arbitrarily here-- so 50.

2303
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,370
This is not normal to
program off to the side.

2304
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:08,130
But I'm now going to say this.

2305
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:14,460
When Video Motion is 50, go ahead
and Play Sound Meow like this.

2306
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,170
So the cat is still in that world.

2307
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:18,970
I'm going to stop the
program and rerun it.

2308
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:21,090
So here we go, Green Flag.

2309
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:24,780
And now here comes-- all
right, this is a little creepy,

2310
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:27,120
the way I'm petting the cat, but--

2311
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,640
and-- [SIGH]

2312
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,600


2313
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:32,940
[MEOWING]

2314
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:33,440
OK.

2315
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,750
[LAUGHTER]

2316
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:36,290
There we go.

2317
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:37,910
OK, so 50 was too big of a number.

2318
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:39,500
I have to pet the cat faster.

2319

2321
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,940
Whereas this, if--

2322
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,410
I don't know--

2323
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:48,330

2324
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:49,924
Yeah, so--

2325
01:41:49,924 --> 01:41:50,710
[MEOW]

2326
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:53,618
OK, so you can make things even
more interactive in this way

2327
01:41:53,618 --> 01:41:55,410
by just assembling
different puzzle pieces.

2328
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:58,050
And honestly, there are so many
different puzzle pieces in here.

2329
01:41:58,050 --> 01:42:00,610
We're not going to even scratch
the surface of a lot of them.

2330
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:02,940
But they generally
just do what they say.

2331
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:06,480
And indeed, when you see on
the screen here this pallet

2332
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:09,330
of puzzle pieces, really a lot of
programming, especially early on,

2333
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:12,970
when learning a language, is just trying
different things and try and fail.

2334
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:17,070
And if it doesn't work quite right,
look for an alternative solution

2335
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:20,000
there too, as even I just
had to do a moment ago.

2336
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,250
Well, let's go ahead and use, actually,
how about another example of something

2337
01:42:23,250 --> 01:42:24,720
a predecessor of yours made?

2338
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:28,830
Let me go ahead and grab a program
I opened in advance here called

01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:32,520

brave volunteer to come up,

who is willing to whack a mole
with their head, virtually?

2341
01:42:38,895 --> 01:42:40,770
Maybe-- OK, let's see,
how about in way back?

2342
01:42:40,770 --> 01:42:42,300
You want to come on down?

2343
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:45,327

5 seconds.

2377
01:43:53,790 --> 01:43:55,710
Notice the score's up to 18 already.

2378
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:58,410
Pretty good.

2379
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:00,990

for Josh, if we could.

01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,380


2382
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:09,020
So notice how using some
fairly simple primitives,

2383
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:11,330
things do get interesting pretty fast.

2384
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:12,560
And how was that implemented?

2385
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,560
Well, there were probably
at least four sprites.

2386
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,222
So you're not confined to just one cat.

2387
01:44:16,222 --> 01:44:18,930
You can create more and more
sprites, change what they look like.

2388
01:44:18,930 --> 01:44:20,930
So they actually look
like a mole, in this case.

2389
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:23,990
There's probably some conditionals
in there, some loops for 30 seconds.

2390
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:27,200
That's checking if Josh's
head's movement is exceeding

2391
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,210
some value over this
way or over this way,

2392
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:31,550
then increment something
called a variable.

2393
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:32,450
We'll see those too.

2394
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:34,490
Just like in algebra
you might have x and y

2395
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:37,700
and z, storing values like
numbers, so can computer programs,

2396
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:42,350
have variables called x or y or z,
or more descriptively called Score,

2397
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:44,810
as in this case at top
right, or another variable

2398
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:47,780
called Countdown, typically one
word in code, but in this case

2399
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:49,632
two words, that just store some value.

2400
01:44:49,632 --> 01:44:51,590
So there's probably some
math going on in there

2401
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:55,040
whereby the author of this program
just is incrementing, that is,

2402
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:59,060
adding 1 and 1 every time it detected
that a mole had been whacked,

2403
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:00,570
in this case, with movement.

2404
01:45:00,570 --> 01:45:04,910
So back in the day, I, myself, actually
implemented my very first program

2405
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:08,180
in Scratch when I was a graduate
student, actually, at MIT--

2406
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:11,290
cross-registered at MIT, taking
a class from MIT's Media Lab,

2407
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:14,540
specifically, the lifelong kindergarten
group, which is the group that created

2408
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:15,500
Scratch, itself.

2409
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:19,580
And the program I wrote all
those years ago and still

2410
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:22,040
rather cling to is a
little something here

2411
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:26,620
called Oscartime, that I thought I'd
play just a quick excerpt of myself

2412
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:27,120
here.

2413
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:30,530
So in this case, consider,
as the music starts playing,

2414
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:33,800
how this program, which is much
more sophisticated, certainly,

2415
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,060
than the earliest "Say hello" examples
we just did might also be implemented.

click the Green Flag.

01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:56,440
If I'm touching the mouse
cursor, it follows me.

2422
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:59,920
If I hover over the
trash can, it responds.

2423
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,600
If I let go, in some kind
of loop, Oscar pops out,

2424
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:06,910
creates a variable
with the current score.

--anything dirty or dingy--

need to keep playing this up

see that it's going to escalate.

some time apparently.

01:46:54,490 --> 01:46:56,032
to have the game constantly changing.

2447
01:46:56,032 --> 01:46:58,073
And indeed, I'm going to
go ahead and click Stop,

2448
01:46:58,073 --> 01:47:00,860
since I spent like eight hours
plus, years ago, making this.

2449
01:47:00,860 --> 01:47:02,602
And I can never listen
to the song again,

2450
01:47:02,602 --> 01:47:04,810
not that I should be anyway
at this point in my life.

2451
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:09,670
But this song is synchronized then with
a lot of the actions that's happening.

2452
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:12,130
And ultimately, there's just
a lot of building blocks.

2453
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:15,610
But I didn't sit down and implement
Oscartime, as I called it, all at once.

2454
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:17,500
I really did take baby
steps, so to speak.

2455
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:21,970
And I figured out, well, how could I
decompose this vision I had at the time

2456
01:47:21,970 --> 01:47:24,220
to create this game ultimately?

2457
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:26,470
And how do I bite off maybe
the easiest parts first?

2458
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:29,912
And honestly, the first thing I did was
I found this image, and I just dragged

2459
01:47:29,912 --> 01:47:31,120
and dropped it into Scratch--

2460
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:33,580
OK, done-- like, lamppost is installed.

2461
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:34,575
It doesn't do anything.

2462
01:47:34,575 --> 01:47:35,450
It's not interactive.

2463
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:37,995
But I at least set the stage,
so to speak, for the program.

2464
01:47:37,995 --> 01:47:39,370
Then what else might I have done?

2465
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:40,640
Well, let me do this.

2466
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:44,290
Let me go ahead and open
up in another editor here

2467
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:48,980
an early incarnation of
Oscartime by doing this.

2468
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:51,220
Let me go into Oscartime here.

2469
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:52,510
Let me full screen this.

2470
01:47:52,510 --> 01:47:54,190
And here you have--

2471
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:56,080
let me hide the trash
for just a moment--

2472
01:47:56,080 --> 01:48:00,010
is what I might call the second
version of my program, wherein,

2473
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:03,220
at the top right of the stage here,
I had the lamppost, which I just

2474
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:06,267
dragged and dropped and got going,
but then I added an actual sprite.

2475
01:48:06,267 --> 01:48:09,100
And it has to be a sprite if you
want it to do things interactively.

2476
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,420
The lamppost-- not a sprite.

2477
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:13,240
It's just an image a costume,
if you will, for the whole

2478
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,680
stage itself, a backdrop.

2479
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:16,780
But this thing is indeed
a sprite because it

2480
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:20,240
needs to respond to code and
events, like dragging and dropping.

2481
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:23,960
So what might I have done
early on with that code?

2482
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:26,350
Well, maybe the first
version would have been

2483
01:48:26,350 --> 01:48:30,250
something like this, whereby my
very first version of Oscartime

2484
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:32,170
might have said
something like, oh, this.

2485
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:35,500
How about, let me control the program
as before-- or, rather, events.

2486
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:38,630
When the Green Flag is
clicked, what do I want to do?

2487
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:43,600
Well, I want to go ahead and
forever do something like this.

2488
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,687
Forever-- so I want the lid
to open up if I touch it.

2489
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:49,270
So if the cursor gets near the
lid, I want the lid to open up.

2490
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:51,340
And then if I move away,
I want it to close.

2491
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,640
So how can I do that?

2492
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:56,080
I want an If, but I just don't want
one question, I really want two,

2493
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,200
a fork in the road that goes
left or right, so to speak.

2494
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:02,830
And let me grab this puzzle
piece here, as I did long ago.

2495
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:04,690
So notice, it grows to fill.

2496
01:49:04,690 --> 01:49:06,430
What's the question I want to ask?

2497
01:49:06,430 --> 01:49:08,680
Well, under Sensing, I'm
going to go ahead here

2498
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:12,670
and say If this trashcan is
Touching the Mouse Pointer--

2499
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:13,863
what do I want to do?

2500
01:49:13,863 --> 01:49:16,030
Well, I want to change what
the trashcan looks like.

2501
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:17,740
And this part, I did
in advance of class.

2502
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:21,040
If you go up here to Costumes, this is
where all the graphical stuff happens.

2503
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:25,720
And you'll see that I imported a
whole bunch of different costumes

2504
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:29,080
that effectively, much like a
video, when you play them quickly,

2505
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,423
creates the illusion of
movement, some animation.

2506
01:49:31,423 --> 01:49:33,340
But it's really just
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot--

2507
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:35,320
different images showing on the screen.

2508
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:39,250
Well, some of these costumes
are called like Oscar1, Oscar2.

2509
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:40,810
Oscar1 is closed.

2510
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:42,070
Oscar2 is open.

2511
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:43,730
So let's just deal with those first.

2512
01:49:43,730 --> 01:49:48,100
So if I'm touching the mouse pointer,
let me go under-- how about Looks?

2513
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,680
And we didn't use this before,
but there's this block,

2514
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:52,870
Switch Costume to Something Else.

2515
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:55,150
I'm going to drag and drop
this inside of the If.

2516
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:57,070
And notice it's a little bit indented.

2517
01:49:57,070 --> 01:50:00,730
I'm going to change it
not to Oscar8, but Oscar2.

2518
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:03,340
Otherwise, If Not Touching
the Mouse Pointer--

2519
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:05,890
this is the other direction
in the fork in the road--

2520
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:10,840
let's go ahead and switch the costume
back to what I described as Oscar1.

2521
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,400
So let me run this program.

2522
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,900
And not much of interest
is happening yet.

2523
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:18,550
But notice, if I move
the cursor up, down--

2524
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:20,030
but how is that working?

2525
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:22,940
It's just changing the costume
that's being overlaid on the sprite.

2526
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:24,790
So it looks like interactivity,
but you are really

2527
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:25,998
just changing the aesthetics.

2528
01:50:25,998 --> 01:50:29,135
And we humans are just kind of
assuming, oh, it's opening up.

2529
01:50:29,135 --> 01:50:30,760
Well, no, it's just changing a costume.

2530
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:31,802
So here's the difference.

2531
01:50:31,802 --> 01:50:34,210
The high-level abstraction--
trashcan opening.

2532
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:36,850
The lower-level implementation
detail-- costume

2533
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:38,500
changing, creating that illusion.

2534
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,680
And if I want it to look prettier, I
could just have many other costumes

2535
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:45,220
and go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
to create more frames per second,

2536
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:46,130
if you will.

2537
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:48,820
So I need to do one other thing.

2538
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:51,130
Maybe if I accidentally
leave the trashcan open,

2539
01:50:51,130 --> 01:50:52,750
let me make one change here.

2540
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,730
Let me make sure that
the very first thing

2541
01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:58,360
I do when the Green Flag is clicked,
is always start with the trashcan

2542
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:01,810
closed because otherwise, you
might accidentally leave it open.

2543
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:03,590
So this gets me into some default state.

2544
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:08,133
So now it's always closed until
I manually hover over it instead.

2545
01:51:08,133 --> 01:51:09,550
Well, what might I have done next?

2546
01:51:09,550 --> 01:51:13,587
Well, if I wanted to introduce something
like the trash, I need a second sprite.

2547
01:51:13,587 --> 01:51:15,670
And here, in advance, I
grabbed the image already.

2548
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:18,310
Let me pretend that this never happened.

2549
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:20,260
Let me drag this away here.

2550
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:24,033
And now I have nothing in my code
area for this piece of trash.

2551
01:51:24,033 --> 01:51:25,200
But it is the second sprite.

2552
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,900
And all I did was I clicked on
the little cat plus icon here,

2553
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:29,190
created a second sprite.

2554
01:51:29,190 --> 01:51:30,330
I named it trash.

2555
01:51:30,330 --> 01:51:32,250
I added a costume for it.

2556
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:34,170
Sort of the aesthetic
stuff, I did in advance.

2557
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:36,360
But here I'll do now the code.

2558
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,720
How do I want to do this?

2559
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:42,160
Well, how about when the Green
Flag is clicked, for the trash can,

2560
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:45,090
I want the trash can in parallel to do--

2561
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:48,190
I want the trash, the piece
of trash, to do its own thing.

2562
01:51:48,190 --> 01:51:52,500
So what I want it to do is maybe
let's do Motion, how about?

2563
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,240
And let's go to a specific coordinate.

2564
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,750
Now, there's a lot of options here.

2565
01:51:55,750 --> 01:52:00,870
There's Turning, Go to a Random
Position, Go to x,y, Glide,

2566
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:01,740
more elegantly.

2567
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:03,990
There's a lot of different
ways to implement movement.

2568
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:06,310
I just want it to go to a
very specific location first.

2569
01:52:06,310 --> 01:52:09,000
So I'm just going to go to x,y first.

2570
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,350
And I'm going to say
x, how about, will be--

2571
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:14,470
let's not hardcode this.

2572
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:18,120
Let's just have it be-- well, let's
do it at 0, initially, and then 240.

2573
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:21,360
So-- whoops-- let's do 0,240
so that this piece of trash

2574
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,410
always starts at the top
middle of the screen.

2575
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:26,160
If you think back to that coordinate
system, 0,0 is in the middle.

2576
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:28,230
240 is straight above it.

2577
01:52:28,230 --> 01:52:31,150
All right, now, after I do
that, what do I want to do?

2578
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:34,980
Well, how about I control
this thing by forever falling.

2579
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:36,427
Now, how do I make the trash move?

2580
01:52:36,427 --> 01:52:38,010
We haven't seen this puzzle piece yet.

2581
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:42,390
But under Motion, the very first thing
is called Move Some Number of Steps.

2582
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:43,380
By default, it's 10.

2583
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:44,880
But we'll do it more simply.

2584
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,790
Let me go ahead and move--

2585
01:52:47,790 --> 01:52:48,660
oh, sorry.

2586
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:52,350
Move is going to move it in
whatever direction it's facing.

2587
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:53,753
I only want it to move down.

2588
01:52:53,753 --> 01:52:56,670
So here, even I'm getting confused
as to how many different ways there

2589
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:57,540
are to do things.

2590
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:59,680
What I thing I want to do is this.

2591
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:03,670
Let me only change my y-axis as follows.

2592
01:53:03,670 --> 01:53:06,060
So here's another puzzle
piece called Change y.

2593
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:07,680
So again, y is the vertical.

2594
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:11,400
So let me just change
y by one pixel downward

2595
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:14,170
at a time, so -1 one pixel at a time.

2596
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:15,540
So it's kind of slow.

2597
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:17,010
And I think now--

2598
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:17,890
I think that's it.

2599
01:53:17,890 --> 01:53:18,990
Let me hit Stop.

2600
01:53:18,990 --> 01:53:21,700
Notice that my trashcan is
still going to be interactive.

2601
01:53:21,700 --> 01:53:23,370
I haven't changed or deleted that code.

2602
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:26,850
I've just added now code
for my piece of trash.

2603
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:30,120
If I click the Green Flag, notice that--

2604
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:32,920
after I enable it-- let
me start that again.

2605
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:34,320
I had it hidden for before class.

2606
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,403
But let me enable it now--

2607
01:53:35,403 --> 01:53:40,080
Green Flag, notice it starts dead
center, at x equals 0, y equals 240,

2608
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,750
and it's dropping one pixel at a time.

2609
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:46,470
If that seems a little boring, we
can change it to -10 pixels at a time

2610
01:53:46,470 --> 01:53:47,530
and, boom, it's done.

2611
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:49,780
So that's how you might
change the speed of a program.

2612
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:51,750
But I'm going to leave
it more simply as -1.

2613
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:54,708
And honestly, it would be nice if it
doesn't always start from the top.

2614
01:53:54,708 --> 01:53:57,083
Otherwise, this game is not
going to be very interactive.

2615
01:53:57,083 --> 01:54:00,580
I'm literally going to be grabbing the
trash from the same place every time.

2616
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:03,250
So why don't I, instead, Stop this.

2617
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:06,550
Let me go under Operators, and
let's pick a random number.

2618
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:08,370
So let me change the hardcoded--

2619
01:54:08,370 --> 01:54:12,210
the manually inputted-- 0, and
let's make x be somewhere between 0,

2620
01:54:12,210 --> 01:54:15,660
so in the middle and
all the way over to--

2621
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:18,000
what was it-- oh, I
got my numbers wrong--

2622
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,970
240 and my y will be 180.

2623
01:54:20,970 --> 01:54:23,560
Sorry, I got my x and my y confused.

2624
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:25,420
So let me play this again.

2625
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:27,645
And now we have a game
that's more like games

2626
01:54:27,645 --> 01:54:29,520
you might have played
growing up or even now,

2627
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:30,978
like there's some randomness to it.

2628
01:54:30,978 --> 01:54:33,660
So the CPU, so to speak, is
doing something more interesting.

2629
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:34,570
Let me run it again.

2630
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:35,820
Now it's a little to the left.

2631
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:36,600
Let me run it again.

2632
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:38,058
Now it's a little more to the left.

2633
01:54:38,058 --> 01:54:39,630
Again-- now it's back to the right.

2634
01:54:39,630 --> 01:54:41,640
So randomness just makes
games more interesting.

2635
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:44,130
And this is why when you play any
video game, if different things are

2636
01:54:44,130 --> 01:54:46,172
happening, there's probably
just some randomness.

2637
01:54:46,172 --> 01:54:48,360
And it's quantized as
just a simple number.

2638
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:52,050
Now, I think I just need one
final flourish here, if I may.

2639
01:54:52,050 --> 01:54:54,060
Let me go ahead and add this.

2640
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:57,570
How about Events-- or rather--

2641
01:54:57,570 --> 01:54:58,380
yes, Events.

2642
01:54:58,380 --> 01:55:02,700
When Green Flag is clicked, I can do
multiple things within the same sprite.

2643
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:05,190
They don't all have to be
attached to the same one.

2644
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:10,110
Let me go ahead and forever go
ahead and do something else.

2645
01:55:10,110 --> 01:55:13,470
How about, Whenever the Trash is--

2646
01:55:13,470 --> 01:55:17,500
how about-- Touching the Trash Can--

2647
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:20,850
so Forever If-- let's see,
I need a Sensing block.

2648
01:55:20,850 --> 01:55:24,000
So how about, Is Touching--

2649
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,530
not the Mouse Pointer, this time,
but Touching Oscar himself there.

2650
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:30,810
Now let's see what happens.

2651
01:55:30,810 --> 01:55:33,750
All right, so let's go ahead
and click the Green Flag.

2652
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:37,560
Now I go down over here and let go.

2653
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:41,340
OK, I kind of want it to
go into the trash can.

2654
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:43,620
How do I make it go into the trash can?

2655
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:47,610
How can we take this high-level
idea, put trash into the trash can,

2656
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:49,950
and make it seem to disappear?

2657
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:51,520
Logically, what could we do?

2658
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:52,370
Yeah--

2659
01:55:52,370 --> 01:55:53,245
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

2660
01:55:53,245 --> 01:55:56,037
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, so when it
touches it, let's have it disappear.

2661
01:55:56,037 --> 01:55:56,910
So I could hide it.

2662
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:59,490
Or honestly, if the game is
going to be ongoing, like it was,

2663
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:01,980
letting me drop more and
more trash, let me just

2664
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:04,380
have it go ahead and pick
a new random location.

2665
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:05,560
So let me do this.

2666
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:09,073
Let me go ahead and Copy this
puzzle piece up here and Duplicate.

2667
01:56:09,073 --> 01:56:10,740
And I don't want the whole thing, sorry.

2668
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:12,400
Let me get rid of this.

2669
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:13,540
Let me just do this.

2670
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:16,720
Let me go back to some
random location at the top.

2671
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:17,940
So now notice what happens.

2672
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:19,950
If I click and drag
on it-- here it goes--

2673
01:56:19,950 --> 01:56:23,730
and I let go, it looks like
it's going into the trash can

2674
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:26,318
because it snaps back up
to some random location.

2675
01:56:26,318 --> 01:56:29,610
Now, the only thing I'm not doing really
is keeping track of any kind of score.

2676
01:56:29,610 --> 01:56:33,150
And it turns out, if I full screen
this, it's not going to be draggable,

2677
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:33,940
by default.

2678
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:35,940
So just as a corner case,
so to speak, something

2679
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:40,860
that you might trip over otherwise,
let me go ahead and under, let's

2680
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:45,960
see, Sensing, it turns out I also
need this for the piece of trash.

2681
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,500
There's this way of setting,
in Scratch, a sprite

2682
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,540
to be draggable or not draggable.

2683
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:53,490
I need to explicitly
make it draggable so

2684
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:55,560
that when I do full
screen this thing now,

2685
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:58,320
it still remains draggable
and someone like myself

2686
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,240
can play it again and again.

2687
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:03,120
Well, how about we supplement
this with one final flourish?

2688
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:06,010
Why don't we keep track
now of the user score?

2689
01:57:06,010 --> 01:57:10,560
So how about, when the user
actually drags the piece of trash

2690
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:13,020
to the trash can, let me
go under Variables here,

2691
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:16,590
where, in advance, I've already
made myself a variable called Score.

2692
01:57:16,590 --> 01:57:20,100
I could have called it x or y or z or
ABC, but that's not very descriptive.

2693
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:23,070
In programming, you typically give
things a more descriptive English,

2694
01:57:23,070 --> 01:57:24,450
or some other language, name.

2695
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:26,200
So I called this one Score.

2696
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,710
So how do I want to do this in my Score?

2697
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:31,890
Well, let me go ahead and
initially set this game

2698
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:35,880
score to 0 at the very top
of one of these scripts--

2699
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:37,470
one of these programs up here.

2700
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:42,570
And then any time my
piece of trash is touching

2701
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:49,630
Oscar, let's not just jump to the top,
let's change the score by 1 up here.

2702
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:52,680
So now notice, If Touching Oscar,
Change the Score-- that is,

2703
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,000
Add 1 to the Score--

2704
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,920
and then Pick a new Random location.

2705
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,290
And now Green Flag--

2706
01:57:58,290 --> 01:57:59,520
let's do this slowly.

2707
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:00,540
Here it goes.

2708
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:01,590
The trashcan opens.

2709
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:02,520
I let go.

2710
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:06,660
And now notice, at the top left of my
program, notice the score is now 2.

2711
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:10,140
Notice the score, if I do this
again, is about to become 3.

2712
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:12,870
And so here we have
building blocks, literally,

2713
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:15,910
of making this program
better and better and better.

2714
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:20,610
And so, indeed, that's how you generally
approach solving any problem with code,

2715
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:22,530
be it in Scratch or C
or Python or some other.

2716
01:58:22,530 --> 01:58:24,975
You take this vision you
might have or some vision

2717
01:58:24,975 --> 01:58:26,850
you've been assigned in
a homework assignment

2718
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:29,490
and try to break it down
into these constituent parts

2719
01:58:29,490 --> 01:58:31,530
and just pluck off the easy ones first.

2720
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:33,390
Put the lamp post there
first, and at least

2721
01:58:33,390 --> 01:58:34,980
feel like you're making some progress.

2722
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:37,188
Then pluck off something
like the trash can, and just

2723
01:58:37,188 --> 01:58:38,457
make it do a little thing.

2724
01:58:38,457 --> 01:58:40,540
And it doesn't have to be
in some same order here.

2725
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:42,750
I could have done this in
a million different ways.

2726
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:46,410
But figure out what the small
pieces are that, ultimately,

2727
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:50,760
like a few of the problems we've solved
today, assemble into a greater solution

2728
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,380
there too.

2729
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:56,410
So that you have now a mental model
for these types of blocks and others,

2730
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:58,470
let's return for a moment to this.

2731
01:58:58,470 --> 01:59:02,100
We saw a moment ago that when I
started saying, "Hello, David,"

2732
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:06,670
and nesting those puzzle pieces, we had
a whole different paradigm altogether.

2733
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:10,630
My input for that second version of,
"Hello, world," was to now pass in,

2734
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:12,300
for instance, "What's Your Name?"

2735
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:15,000
into my function, called Ask.

2736
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,610
That gave me not a side
effect, but what I called,

2737
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:21,690
again, a return value, called
Answer, by default, in Scratch.

2738
01:59:21,690 --> 01:59:25,710
And now notice and recall,
when I had that same output

2739
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:31,260
become the input to my next block, it
looked a little something like this--

2740
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:32,100
Say.

2741
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:36,240
So how does this type of block and
this nesting, this stacking of blocks,

2742
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,710
fit into the same mental model?

2743
01:59:37,710 --> 01:59:42,660
Well, same idea-- my input for that part
of the story is now taking in not one

2744
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:43,790
input but two--

2745
01:59:43,790 --> 01:59:47,190
two arguments-- "hello"
and the answer from before.

2746
01:59:47,190 --> 01:59:50,010
The function, in this case,
is that new block called Join.

2747
01:59:50,010 --> 01:59:53,640
The output thereof is, "Hello,
David," which itself became--

2748
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:55,170
if we sort of animate this--

2749
01:59:55,170 --> 02:00:00,840
the input to my final function,
which indeed was still Say.

2750
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:03,150
And this is only to
say-- no pun intended--

2751
02:00:03,150 --> 02:00:06,570
that almost everything that you
do with these puzzle pieces,

2752
02:00:06,570 --> 02:00:09,605
be it in the context of
Oscartime or the mole whacking

2753
02:00:09,605 --> 02:00:11,730
or even just something
simple like, "Hello, world,"

2754
02:00:11,730 --> 02:00:16,320
will ultimately fit into that
relatively simple mental model there.

2755
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:20,220
Now, I thought we'd end by taking a
look at just a couple of final examples.

2756
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:22,950
These ones, too, made by
some of your predecessors.

2757
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:26,010
And for this, I thought we
would not write code together,

2758
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:27,760
but read it instead.

2759
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:30,960
And so allow me to open
up one other example here

2760
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:34,770
that will show us a few
different versions of a program

2761
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:36,720
that a predecessor made.

2762
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:38,340
Give me just a moment here.

2763
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:42,960
And we'll see how we might build up
to something even more interactive.

2764
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,940
And in just a moment,
we'll see something

2765
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:51,090
they called Ivy's Hardest Game, focused
here on these particular mechanics.

2766
02:00:51,090 --> 02:00:55,110
So here is version 0, so to
speak, of this program, wherein

2767
02:00:55,110 --> 02:00:58,560
the goal was to create a game where you
have to get out of some kind of maze.

2768
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:01,800
And you have to get out, in this case,
the Harvard crest from this maze.

2769
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:04,170
Let me go ahead and just
hit Play on this Green Flag

2770
02:01:04,170 --> 02:01:08,040
so you can see what the first building
block for this program might have been.

2771
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:12,990
Notice that my hand here is actually
on the Arrow keys on my keyboard.

2772
02:01:12,990 --> 02:01:16,800
And it seems that by moving
up, down, left, or right,

2773
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,432
this little crest on the screen
responds in exactly that way.

2774
02:01:20,432 --> 02:01:22,140
Now, let's hypothesize
for just a moment.

2775
02:01:22,140 --> 02:01:24,900
Even though we've not done
anything quite like this before,

2776
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:27,260
how might this code be implemented?

2777
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:30,740
How do you get a sprite,
be it a cat or a crest,

2778
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:34,220
to respond to keys on a keyboard--
might you think intuitively?

2779
02:01:34,220 --> 02:01:34,730
Yeah--

2780
02:01:34,730 --> 02:01:36,983
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

2781
02:01:36,983 --> 02:01:38,900
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah,
there could be something

2782
02:01:38,900 --> 02:01:40,410
sensing what key you're pressing on.

2783
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:42,230
And if you do it again
in forever a loop,

2784
02:01:42,230 --> 02:01:44,600
you'll just constantly be
listening for keystrokes.

2785
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,240
And this is how, like, every
piece of software nowadays works.

2786
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,910
It's constantly waiting
for your phone to be tapped

2787
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:51,690
or something to be typed on the screen.

2788
02:01:51,690 --> 02:01:55,400
So let me go ahead and look inside
of this existing program here.

2789
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:57,890
And there's more going on,
but we'll take a quick glance

2790
02:01:57,890 --> 02:01:59,730
what's actually going on.

2791
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:02,000
Well, up here at top
left, notice, we just

2792
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,850
have Go To x Equals 0 and y Equals 0.

2793
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:07,850
That means put the Harvard crest dead
center in the middle of the stage.

2794
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:10,460
Then we have Forever
two functions that we

2795
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:13,130
made in advance as custom functions--

2796
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:15,500
Listen for Keyboard, Feel for Walls.

2797
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:17,190
So it's doing two things at once.

2798
02:02:17,190 --> 02:02:19,403
It's forever listening
for the keyboard-- up,

2799
02:02:19,403 --> 02:02:21,320
down, left, right-- and
feeling for the walls,

2800
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,278
in the sense that if I
get too far to the left,

2801
02:02:23,278 --> 02:02:26,010
I don't want it to keep
moving past that black wall.

2802
02:02:26,010 --> 02:02:28,520
And if it moves too far to the right, I
don't want it to blow through that wall

2803
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,060
either.

2804
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:32,300
So it's going to do two things
constantly, listening for keyboard

2805
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:34,250
and feeling for walls, so to speak.

2806
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:35,870
And how are those implemented?

2807
02:02:35,870 --> 02:02:37,190
Well, this one's a bit long.

2808
02:02:37,190 --> 02:02:40,080
But on the left here
is Listen for Keyboard.

2809
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:43,760
So this pink puzzle piece,
Listen for Keyboard,

2810
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:47,420
first checks If the Key Up
Arrow is Pressed, question mark,

2811
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:50,570
Boolean expression in a
conditional, Change y By 1.

2812
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:52,040
That means, move it up 1.

2813
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:56,840
Else If the Key Down Arrow is
Pressed, then Change y by -1,

2814
02:02:56,840 --> 02:02:59,540
and similar for Left Arrow,
similar for Right Arrow.

2815
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:02,660
And even though there's not
a loop in this pink function,

2816
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:04,310
there is where I'm using it.

2817
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:06,860
So it's constantly being
asked again and again.

2818
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:08,420
How about feeling for walls?

2819
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,010
Well, over here to the right--

2820
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:13,970
it's a little cut off-- but here
you have, If Touching Left Wall,

2821
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:15,260
Change x by 1.

2822
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:17,200
So if you hit the wall, it's too late.

2823
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:18,950
You're kind of blowing
through it already.

2824
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:23,000
So I want to move it back one pixel
so it's no longer touching that wall.

2825
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,670
Similarly, if it's touching the right
wall, I want to back it up one pixel

2826
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:28,220
so it's no longer touching that wall.

2827
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:31,070
So it's kind of like bouncing
off ever so slightly so that it

2828
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:33,110
doesn't slip through that actual wall.

2829
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:34,340
And what are those walls?

2830
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:38,870
Well, notice down here, it's just
a simple sprite with a black line

2831
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:41,790
that I've oriented vertically
instead of horizontally.

2832
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:45,230
And that's just so that I can ask
questions of these other two sprites.

2833
02:03:45,230 --> 02:03:47,570
Now, that gives me that
form of interactivity.

2834
02:03:47,570 --> 02:03:49,200
What more can I now do?

2835
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:52,410
Well, what if we make things a
little more interactive here?

2836
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:55,640
Let me go ahead and see
inside version 1 our second.

2837
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:58,860
And let me propose what's
going to happen here.

2838
02:03:58,860 --> 02:04:02,600
Well, how might we add a little
something like Yale into the mix?

2839
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:07,460
Well, what's Yale going to do when I hit
the Green Flag now based on this code?

2840
02:04:07,460 --> 02:04:09,920
Any hunches?

2841
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:13,250
Here is the code for my Yale sprite.

2842
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:13,820
Yeah--

2843
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:14,570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

2844
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:15,650
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah,
it's kind of going to be

2845
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:18,203
an adversarially by blocking
my path, theoretically,

2846
02:04:18,203 --> 02:04:19,370
if I keep writing more code.

2847
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:20,030
So why?

2848
02:04:20,030 --> 02:04:22,160
It too goes to the middle of the screen.

2849
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:23,940
It points in direction 90 degrees.

2850
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:26,520
So similarly, there's a
whole degree system as well.

2851
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:27,710
And it forever asks this.

2852
02:04:27,710 --> 02:04:29,750
If Touching the Left Wall Or--

2853
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:30,920
notice the green block--

2854
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:33,900
Touching the Right Wall, then
just Turn around 180 Degrees.

2855
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,900
And indeed, if you think
this through logically,

2856
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:38,570
that just means you're
bouncing this way and this way

2857
02:04:38,570 --> 02:04:42,860
by just flipping yourself around 180
degrees for just this Yale sprite.

2858
02:04:42,860 --> 02:04:46,550
So if I go ahead and zoom in on
this and click the Green Flag,

2859
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:48,350
I can still move up and down.

2860
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:52,170
But Yale is just kind of doing
this all day long, back and forth

2861
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:53,490
and back and forth, forever.

2862
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:55,710
Nothing bad happens if
I try to go through it.

2863
02:04:55,710 --> 02:04:58,010
But we could add that,
certainly, to the mix.

2864
02:04:58,010 --> 02:05:01,760
In fact, let's add one final feature
before we play this particular game.

2865
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:06,320
And let me go ahead and open up the
final version of these building blocks

2866
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,640
that adds MIT to the mix.

2867
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:10,940
So here is MIT.

2868
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:13,182
Someone want to explain
what this code does?

2869
02:05:13,182 --> 02:05:14,390
And this is what we're doing.

2870
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:15,470
This itself is a skill.

2871
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:17,810
Reading someone else's
code and understanding it

2872
02:05:17,810 --> 02:05:20,640
is half of the part of
programming besides writing.

2873
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:21,140
Yeah--

2874
02:05:21,140 --> 02:05:22,015
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

2875
02:05:22,015 --> 02:05:24,960
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, it's chasing
down the Harvard logo outline.

2876
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,870
So this is apparently
the name of the costume

2877
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:30,050
that this student made,
Harvard logo outline.

2878
02:05:30,050 --> 02:05:32,600
And apparently, it goes to
a random position first.

2879
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,700
But then it forever points to Harvard.

2880
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:36,830
So no matter where I'm
moving it, up, down, left,

2881
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:39,413
or right, MIT is being a little
more strategic than Yale,

2882
02:05:39,413 --> 02:05:40,830
bouncing back and forth like this.

2883
02:05:40,830 --> 02:05:43,440
So let's go ahead and play
this one in full screen.

2884
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,540
And here we have a Green Flag.

2885
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:50,750
So if I move up, MIT,
rather strategically,

2886
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:53,210
is following me no matter where I go.

2887
02:05:53,210 --> 02:05:55,190
All right, so still,
nothing bad happens.

2888
02:05:55,190 --> 02:05:56,940
But now it's struggling, right?

2889
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:58,190
It's going up, down, up, down.

2890
02:05:58,190 --> 02:06:00,950
It's trying to follow me
even though I'm not moving.

2891
02:06:00,950 --> 02:06:02,630
So we need some final flourishes.

2892
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:06,740
And so I think, for this, we
need perhaps one final volunteer.

2893
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:09,830
After this, cake awaits
for everyone outside,

2894
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:11,990
as is an end of first
lecture CS50 tradition.

2895
02:06:11,990 --> 02:06:14,840
Would you like to come
up and be our volunteer?

2896
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:17,230
[APPLAUSE]

2897
02:06:17,230 --> 02:06:23,450


2898
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:24,040
All right.

2899
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:28,330
And so this will be the actual version
but written by one of your predecessors

2900
02:06:28,330 --> 02:06:30,040
that I'll full screen here.

2901
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:33,040
It's going to stitch together all
of these same primitives and more,

2902
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:36,430
but add the notion of scores and
lives so that there's actually

2903
02:06:36,430 --> 02:06:41,260
a goal, which in this case is to move
the Harvard crest to constantly pursue

2904
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:44,650
the character on the right-hand side
so that your sprite touches that one.

2905
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:46,533
Would you like to introduce yourself?

02:06:46,533 --> 02:06:47,950
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is Mohammed.

2907
02:06:47,950 --> 02:06:49,000
DAVID J. MALAN: All right, wonderful.

2908
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:49,630
Welcome aboard.

2909
02:06:49,630 --> 02:06:51,910
And here we come with some
instructions and final

2910
02:06:51,910 --> 02:06:56,048
flourish if we want to keep the lights
up but perhaps increase the music.

2911
02:06:56,048 --> 02:06:58,236
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2912
02:06:58,236 --> 02:06:58,736


2913
02:06:58,736 --> 02:07:00,486
[MUSIC - MC HAMMER, "U CAN'T TOUCH
 THIS"]

2914
02:07:00,486 --> 02:07:02,150
MC HAMMER: (SINGING) You can't this.

2915
02:07:02,150 --> 02:07:03,025
You can't touch this.

2916
02:07:03,025 --> 02:07:05,567
DAVID J. MALAN: Notice he is
using the up, down, left, right.

2917
02:07:05,567 --> 02:07:07,320
But there's many more walls now.

2918
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:08,730
First level's pretty easy.

2919
02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:13,560
But now Yale's in the mix,
bouncing back and forth.

2920
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:15,420
Again, pretty easy.

2921
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:22,290
Now there's two Yale's at
slightly different positions.

2922
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:23,730
MIT is coming soon.

2923
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:25,432
But first, we have three Yales.

2924
02:07:25,432 --> 02:07:26,640
MC HAMMER: (SINGING) As such.

2925
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,542
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch.

2926
02:07:28,542 --> 02:07:29,625
DAVID J. MALAN: Very nice.

2927
02:07:29,625 --> 02:07:30,125
[APPLAUSE]

2928
02:07:30,125 --> 02:07:33,100
MC HAMMER: (SINGING) I told you,
homeboy, you can't touch this.

2929
02:07:33,100 --> 02:07:36,820
Yeah, that's how it look when
you know you can't touch this.

02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:40,798
Look at my eyes, man,
